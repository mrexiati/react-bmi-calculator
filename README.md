### Installation

After cloning the repository, you can set up and run the application as follows:

1. **Start the Application in Development Mode:**
   Run the app locally using Yarn. This will launch the app in development mode.
   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```
   - The app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will reload with any edits, and lint errors will be shown in the console.

2. **Run Tests:**
   Launch the interactive test runner. 
   ```sh
   yarn test
   ```
   - For more details on running tests, see the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

3. **Build for Production:**
   Create a production build in the `build` folder.
   ```sh
   yarn build
   ```
   - This command optimizes the build for best performance: the build is minified, and filenames include hashes. For deployment guidance, refer to the [deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

4. **Eject Configuration (Irreversible):**
   Use `eject` to customize build tools and configuration options.
   ```sh
   yarn eject
   ```
   - **Warning:** This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone! Ejecting is suitable if you need direct control over build tools and configuration settings.
